**Installation steps can be seen at the "stage 3" section on [the pdf](https://github.com/username-pass/exelper/blob/e7527fbbeac51dddd4baf7097b1717f0b6a8e4d0/files/skiovox.pdf)**

This extension:

- Fixes most shortcut functionality within the exploit
- Allows for resizing and dragging of windows
- Makes it easier to add Google accounts and use the Web Store within the exploit

*Note: You can exit fullscreen videos by pressing ctrl+T after you've set up the shortcuts*
